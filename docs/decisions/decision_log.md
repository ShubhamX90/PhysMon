## 2026-06-13 - Packaging Backend

- Date: 2026-06-13
- Decision: Use `setuptools.build_meta` instead of `setuptools.backends.legacy:build` in
  `pyproject.toml`.
- Rationale: Sharanga's Python 3.11 pip/setuptools stack could not import
  `setuptools.backends.legacy`, causing the required editable install (`-e .`) in
  `environment.yml` to fail. `setuptools.build_meta` preserves the intended editable
  package install while allowing the environment to build.
- Proposal section(s): Reproducibility and Release Plan (§17)
- Supplementary decision/assumption IDs: A2

## 2026-06-13 - Baukit Install Source

- Date: 2026-06-13
- Decision: Install Baukit from `git+https://github.com/davidbau/baukit.git` instead of
  `baukit>=0.1`.
- Rationale: No `baukit` distribution matching `baukit>=0.1` is available from PyPI in
  Sharanga's pip environment. The GitHub source preserves Baukit as the fallback hooking
  dependency required for Stage 2 if TransformerLens support is insufficient.
- Proposal section(s): Activation Extraction Tooling (§7.3), Stage 2 (§12)
- Supplementary decision/assumption IDs: A2

## 2026-06-13 - Local CPU Development Environment

- Date: 2026-06-13
- Decision: Build the local CPU-only development environment as a repo-local `uv` virtual
  environment in `.venv` instead of installing a new local Conda distribution.
- Rationale: This Mac did not have `conda`, `mamba`, or `micromamba` available. Using
  `uv` let us create a Python 3.11 CPU development environment quickly while preserving
  the canonical GPU environment specification in `environment.yml` for Sharanga.
- Proposal section(s): Environment Setup (§I.3)
- Supplementary decision/assumption IDs: A1, A2
